              I am a passionate and highly motivated full stack developer with
              experience using frontend and backend technologies such as
              JavaScript, ReactJS, Bootstrap, Material-UI, Node, Ruby, Sinatra,
              and Rails. I love to build new projects and debugging. I am also
              committed to writing clean, readable and scalable code!<br></br>
              <br></br>I graduated from New York University, where I received my
              bachelorâ€™s degree in chemical engineering and immersed myself in
              mathematics, physics and engineering. I found my love for coding
              after college and wish to become a seasoned and professional
              software engineer!
              <br></br>
              <br></br> I have recently graduated from Flatiron School's 15 week
              immersive boot camp and would love to apply my problem solving and
              programming and team-oriented skill set to help clients and
              companies meet their goals.
